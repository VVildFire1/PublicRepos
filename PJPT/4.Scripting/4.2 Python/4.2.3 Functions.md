# 4.2.3 Functions

In Python, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions allow you to organize code into logical and modular units, making your code more readable, maintainable, and reusable.

## Function Definition

A function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses, and a colon. The function may also have parameters (optional) and a return statement (optional) to send back a result.

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Function Call

To execute a function, you need to call it by its name, followed by parentheses.

```python
greet()
```

## Function Parameters

Functions can accept parameters, which are variables that hold values passed to the function when it is called. Parameters allow you to customize the behavior of a function based on the values you provide.

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Alice")
```

In the example above, the `greet()` function accepts a parameter named `name`. When the function is called with an argument, such as "Alice", the value is assigned to the `name` parameter within the function body.

## Return Statement

Functions can also return values using the `return` statement. The returned value can be assigned to a variable or used directly in expressions.

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 7
```

In this example, the `add_numbers()` function takes two parameters (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum. The returned value is then assigned to the `result` variable and printed.

Functions provide a way to encapsulate reusable code and improve the structure of your programs. They can take inputs, perform computations, and produce outputs, allowing you to modularize your code and make it more efficient and maintainable.
